    "Helsinki Institute of Physics is involved in a search for charged Higgs bosons in the CMS collaboration. If one adds a second scalar doublet to the standard model, we get in total five physical Higgs bosons. Three of them are neutral and two have an electrical charge. Models predicting these bosons are called *two-Higgs-doublet models* and they are the first step towards, for instance, supersymmetry and therefore an observation of a charged Higgs boson would be clear evidence of Beyond the Standard Model theories. \n",

    "We will use two simulated data sets in our analysis: \n",

    "- Charged Higgs boson signal sample\n",
    "- W + jet background sample \n",

    "With these we will study the decay of charged Higgs bosons into a tau lepton and a tau neutrino.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When searching for new particles, we need to impose cuts on observable variables to increase the signal-to-background ratio. Imposing a cut means selecting collision events based on some criterion. By understanding the nature and the underlying physics of different processes, we can make selections on the phase space to target regions where we expect our process of interest to have a significant contribution. As a simple example, if we are interested in a process, which produces two leptons, then we can cut away all recorded collision events which didn't produce at least two leptons.\n",
    "\n",
    "When imposing a cut, we typically cut away background events (i.e. collision events we are not interested in) but also some signal events (i.e. events of interest). We want to make sure that every cut takes only a small amount of signal events away, while reducing the number of background events significantly more. \n",
    "\n",
    "The helicity of tau leptons carries information about their origin, so it provides a useful handle for discrimination between the tau leptons originating from charged Higgs boson decays and those originating from a W decays. Therefore, we will use a variable called $R_{\\tau}$ to discriminate between the signal and the background in this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "With particle detectors, we record the flight paths of the charged particles produced in a collision event. These paths are typically called tracks, and they are measured using tracker subdetectors. \"Leading track\" refers to the track with the highest measured $p_T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neutrinos are always left-handed in the Standard Model. Tau leptons produced in a charged Higgs boson decay are always right-handed, since a charged Higgs boson is a scalar particle. On the other hand (pun intended), when a vector boson W decays into a tau lepton, the tau lepton is forced to be left-handed, since the neutrino is left-handed. It turns out that this influences the kinematics of the tau lepton decay. Unlike electrons and muons, taus can decay into hadrons. Emission of the particle corresponding to the leading track is more likely to be towards the tau lepton's direction of movement for the right-handed tau. Therefore, in laboratory coordinates, the leading tracks originally caused by the decay of the charged Higgs boson have, on average, larger momentum than the ones caused by the decay of the W boson.\n",
    "\n",
    "$R_{\\tau}$ is defined as the leading track $p_T$ of a tau lepton divided by the $p_T$ of the tau lepton. In the data files, the momentum variables are called _LeadingTrackPt_ and _TauPt_. $R_{\\tau}$ can be calculated by\n",
